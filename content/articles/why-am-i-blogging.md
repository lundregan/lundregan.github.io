## Why Am I Blogging?
Inspired by two of my favorite quotes from Mortimer J. Adler and Albert Einstein;

> *The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks*
> 
>> **Mortimer J. Adler**

> *If you can't explain it to a six year-old, you probably don't understand it yourself*
>
>> **Albert Einstein**

I take this to mean that to really **Know** and understand something, 
you both need to be able to explain and express that to others

To do so with people that may not have the same technical vocabulary
or the same knowledge of techno-jargon.

### Blog Goals;

- Cement my knowledge of certain subjects and topics.
- Teach others about the things I find interesting.
- A creative outlet, especially when between attempting difficult technical challenges.
