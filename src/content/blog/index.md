## Why Am I Blogging?

Inspired by two of my favourite quotes from: **Mortimer J. Adler** and **Albert Einstein**;

> *The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks* 
>
> **Mortimer J. Adler**

> *If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you probably don't understand it yourself*
>
> **Albert Einstein**

I take this to mean that to really know and understand something, 
you both need to be able to express it to others 
and to do so with people that may not have the same technical vocalblery 
or same knowledge of jargon.

### Blog Goals;
- Cement my knowledge of certain subjects and topics.
- Teach others about the things I find interesting.
- A creative outlet, espacially when between attempting difficult technical challenges.
