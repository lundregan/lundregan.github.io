# What do you mean everyone should know how to code?

Firstly I want to make a distinction from being able to code, and learning how to code.

##### Learning to code;
- The process of learning how to break down problems into small chunks
- Making iterative changes to get closer to the desired result
- An understanding logic

##### Knowing how to code;
- Being able to develop software, and to solve problems.
- Creating algorithms to solve problems with particular restraints, e.g. limited Time/Resources

It would be fantastic if everyone knew how to code and solve problems, but I want to focus on the process and the tools you learn whilst learning to code.

# Anyone can learn how to code;

Nearly everyone can become a good developer, some may even become great developers. But everyone can learn how to develop.

The requirements for learning to code are thus;
- Break down problems
- Take small steps to solve those problems

You may get the impression from movies, where you may see some nerd putting on hacking gloves and typing on multiple keyboards staring at 4 different screens all racing with numbers and foreign symbols.

But as we everything in Hollywood there are misconceptions and misrepresentations.

The reality is more like waking up and grabbing some nice breakfast, most likely make a cup of tea or coffee, sit down at the desk and work at about the pace of doing a crossword puzzle.

# How does learning to code help me?

The ability to breakdown problems and solve them is perhaps one of the most important skills.
Programming is purely that process.

Being able to breakdown problems helps when dealing with a plethora of problems for example;
- Deciding on the best medical choices, whilst balancing emotional strain
- Designing Products
- Improving your work efficiency (Clean all the beds on the floor in a faster way... Well that's extra time for your break)
- Figuring out different funding options for continuing business

I think having one hobby that sharpens this skill is invaluable to everybody.
There are other ways of working this skill though E.G
- Chess, Crosswords, Suduku, and other Strategic Games
- Learning Mathematics, and other STEM fields

# Is it hard to learn to code?



# The 4 Steps of development
- Understand the problem
- Take small incremental steps to solve the problem
- Once you have a solution that you think may work, test
- Repeat & Refine

At every step between, before, and after adding in a lot of research (googling)
